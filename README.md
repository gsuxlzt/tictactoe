# Tic-Tac-Toe

My personal implementation of the game with a somewhat beatable AI. This is part of Free Code Camp's advanced projects for the front-end certification. The working demo can be found [here](https://github.com/gsuxlzt/tictactoe)

## User Stories

1. I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

2. My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

3. I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
